Hi! It's my first Todo app - writed with react and class components.

With this Todo you can.
1. Create tasks.
2. Edit tasks.
3. Remove tasks.
4. Mark as completed - by clicking on task.
5. Filter all tasks by 'All', 'Completed' and 'Active'.
6. Finally, you can reload the page and you won't lose anything.  ---localStorage---

I hope this app will be useful for you :)
