# Getting Started with Create React App

Hi! It's my first Blog - writed with react and class components.

With this Blog you can.

1. Create an account
2. Add posts
3. Edit posts
4. remove posts

In the future i will add opportunity to comment posts.
You can reload the page and you won't lose anything, because all information is saved in your browser localStorage
I hope this app will be useful for you :)
